CAPT CHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) challenges users to solve puzzles or tasks.
Bots often struggle to solve these challenges, effectively filtering out malicious automated activity.
CAPT CHA protects sensitive data and resources from automated attacks, such as brute-force password guessing.
